In order to give myself the best class schedule possible, I wrote
an algorithm for parsing the UGA static registration reports and
generating possible schedules based on my time constraints.

A version is up and running at dawgschedule.com
The schedule generation is pretty self explanatory on the site.

A few things worth noting: my approach towards ajax is quite flawed.
I should have just been passing json rather than html on the callbacks.
Could definitely use a rewrite.

DBPopulator handles scraping the courses from the static listing website.
It was necessary to modify the trust to get past the SSL, but I only modify
it inside of this populator (by modifying the factory itself).

Finally, this site never really received any love on the front-end because
it was more of a proof of concept/problem solving challenge than anything else.

If the switch to the new Oasis doesn't affect the static listings (currently
no new listings for the Fall of 2014 have been posted), I may get around to 
making the site open for more people.
